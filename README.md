# Karri - A WordPress Starter Theme

This is a theme I created for myself as a starting point to develop themes upon, pre WordPress v5.9.

This repository is more a reference as the theme is **unlikely to be maintained**.

Where WordPress is heading in the near future.. it's geared towards using block-based themes.
